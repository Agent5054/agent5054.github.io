According to **Costa Samaras, Director of the Wilton E. Scott Institute for Energy Innovation at Carnegie Mellon University**, building a world without carbon will require us to think in terms of "megaprojects". [Writing for the Roosevelt Institute](https://rooseveltinstitute.org/blog/building-a-world-without-carbon/){.external target="_blank"}, Dr. Samaras notes that in order to meet a target date of 2050 for net zero carbon emissions, a heroic effort will still be needed. We've made a start on the transition, but it remains to be seen what the effects of this administration will be. They're unlikely to be good.
