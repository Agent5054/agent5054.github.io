    "text": "This is an interesting read from the MIT Press Reader: The Anti-Capitalist Case for Standards. Things like this can sometimes seem self-evident, but it’s important to point to areas where collaboration, particularly across national borders, has taken place outside the paradigm of profit making.\nN.B.: comments are enabled on all posts.

    "text": "According to Costa Samaras, Director of the Wilton E. Scott Institute for Energy Innovation at Carnegie Mellon University, building a world without carbon will require us to think in terms of “megaprojects”. Writing for the Roosevelt Institute, Dr. Samaras notes that in order to meet a target date of 2050 for net zero carbon emissions, a heroic effort will still be needed. We’ve made a start on the transition, but it remains to be seen what the effects of this administration will be. They’re unlikely to be good.\nYou can follow Dr. Samaras on Bluesky."
