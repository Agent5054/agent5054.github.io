This is an interesting read from the MIT Press Reader: [The Anti-Capitalist Case for Standards](https://thereader.mitpress.mit.edu/the-anti-capitalist-case-for-standards/){.external target="_blank"}. Things like this can sometimes seem self-evident, but it's important to point to areas where collaboration, particularly across national borders, has taken place outside the paradigm of profit making.
