    "text": "According to Costa Samaras, Director of the Wilton E. Scott Institute for Energy Innovation at Carnegie Mellon University, building a world without carbon will require us to think in terms of “megaprojects”. Writing for the Roosevelt Institute, Dr. Samaras notes that in order to meet a target date of 2050 for net zero carbon emissions, a heroic effort will still be needed. We’ve made a start on the transition, but it remains to be seen what the effects of this administration will be. They’re unlikely to be good.\nYou can follow Dr. Samaras on Bluesky."
