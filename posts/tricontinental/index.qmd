The Tricontinental Institute for Social Research [describes itself](https://thetricontinental.org/about/#mission) as "an international institute guided by popular movements and organisations \[which seeks\] to build a bridge between academic production and political and social movements in order to promote critical thinking and stimulate debates and research with an emancipatory perspective that serves the peopleâ€™s aspirations." It's a resource I return to frequently.

You can read their latest newsletter here: [Twenty-Five Days of Debt-Service Payments Could Emancipate African Women from 40 Billion Hours of Water Harvesting: The Eleventh Newsletter (2025)](https://thetricontinental.org/newsletterissue/women-gender-inequality-poverty/)

I also really enjoyed this article about the environmental remediation efforts in China since 2013: [Reviving Erhai Lake](https://thetricontinental.org/wenhua-zongheng-2024-2-reviving-erhai-lake/)
